Pair Game
This is a simple Pair Matching Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows you to select the number of cards (from 2 to 16, with only even numbers allowed) to play with. Once selected, you can start the game, and a timer will begin with a duration of 1 minute.

How to Play
Select the Number of Cards
Use the form to choose the number of cards you want to play with (only even numbers between 2 and 16 are allowed).
Start the Game
Click on the "Start Game" button to begin the game.
Gameplay
Click on the cards to reveal them. The objective is to find pairs of matching cards.
When two cards are selected, they will remain open if they match, or they will close again if they don’t.
Timer
A timer of 1 minute starts when the game begins. If you match all the cards before the timer runs out, you win.
If the timer reaches 1 minute and you haven’t matched all the cards, the game ends, and an alert will notify you that the game is over.
Game Status
Throughout the game, the button text will change to indicate different stages: starting the game, ongoing gameplay, winning, or the end of the game.
How the Game Works
The game uses Bootstrap classes (row and col) for card layout.
Cards are built from arrays of images and numbers. The numbers are randomly generated and shuffled using functions.
Card colors change when selected, and they open and close using class manipulation on click events.
